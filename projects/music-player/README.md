# Music Player
## About the Project
This music player has been made completely with HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript. The player as of now makes use of HTML template and the songs from the Github repo, to load the soundtracks. Once, the soundtracks are loaded, **the user can:**
1) play the individual song.
2) pause the individual song.
3) can jump to a specific time in the song.
4) switch to another song.

**The basic features of the Music Player are:**
1) It displays the Song Title and Artist's name.
2) It also displays the total song duration,
3) and updates the current lapsed duration too, as the song is playing.
4) It allows user to play and pause any song.
5) It also allows user to jump to a specific time in the song.

## Technologies and Standards Used
**The technologies that have been used are:**
1. HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)
2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
3. JavaScript

The **modular approach** has been taken to code in Javascript for clean and better code.

**There are various tools that have been used throughout the project design and development:**
| Tools                                             | Usage                                             |
|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Figma                                             | For referring to the product design specification |
| [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) | For refining and compressing SVGs                 |

**The main concepts that have been emphasized are:**
1. Responsive Web Design
2. [CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)
3. [CSS Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
4. **BEM Specification**  
  The website is using [BEM — Block Element Modifier](https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/) methodology to create reusable and understandable components in CSS. The idea behind it is to divide the user interface into independent blocks. This makes interface development easy and fast and it allows reuse of existing code without copying and pasting. We are also using [Nested BEM File structure organization](https://en.bem.info/methodology/filestructure/#nested) for CSS.  

5. **Git Conventional Commits Specification**  
  We are using [Git Conventional Commits 1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history making it easier for people to contribute to our projects by communicating the nature of changes clearly.

## Future Improvements
1) To implement the 'Play All' functionality.
2) To fetch the songs from an API.
3) To allow users to add the songs to the playlist.
