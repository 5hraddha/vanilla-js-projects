# Vanilla Javascript Projects
## About the Project
In the front-end space, a lot of frameworks exist: React, Angular, Vue, just to name a few. Every single one of them is awesome and without them, front-end development wouldn’t be in its current state. But what those frameworks, besides all their differences, have in common is that they are all based on **JavaScript**.  
**JavaScript** is what runs the web today. And for every front end developer, no matter if already experienced or at the start of their careers, it’s mandatory to know the basics of **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.  
This repository is a list of projects that I have completed to refresh my skills, learn new things about Javascript, and stay relevant.   

## Technologies and Standards Used
**The technologies that have been used are:**
1. HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)
2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
3. JavaScript

**There are various tools that have been used throughout the project design and development:**
| Tools                                             | Usage                                             |
|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Figma                                             | For referring to the product design specification |
| [TinyPng](https://tinypng.com/)                   | For JPEG/PNG Image Compression                    |
| [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) | For refining and compressing SVGs                 |

**The main concepts that have been emphasized are:**
1. Responsive Web Design
2. [CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)
3. [CSS Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
4. **BEM Specification**  
  The website is using [BEM — Block Element Modifier](https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/) methodology to create reusable and understandable components in CSS. The idea behind it is to divide the user interface into independent blocks. This makes interface development easy and fast and it allows reuse of existing code without copying and pasting. We are also using [Nested BEM File structure organization](https://en.bem.info/methodology/filestructure/#nested) for CSS.  

5. **Git Conventional Commits Specification**  
  We are using [Git Conventional Commits 1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history making it easier for people to contribute to our projects by communicating the nature of changes clearly.
